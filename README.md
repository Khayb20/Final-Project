# Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest Path

An end of semester group project on Data Structures and Algorithms

# Introduction/Problem

Students, especially freshmen in Ashesi, have difficulty navigating around the various offices and classrooms on campus. Due to this, we have decided to create a solution that would aid students in identifying the multiple offices and obtain possible paths that would take them there

# Solution
Using the graphs structure, we created a simple graph to represent various locations in the Ashesi campus and implemented the Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between any two locations on the map. We also used java Swing to create a GUI for users to interact with.
